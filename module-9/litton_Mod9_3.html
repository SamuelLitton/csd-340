        <h2>“Twin Stars Aloft” by Charles Kingsley</h2>

        <p>
            Twin stars, aloft in ether clear, <br>
            Around each other roll alway, <br>
            Within one common <span id="atmosphere">______</span> <br>
            Of their own mutual light and day.
        </p>
        <p>
            And <span id="myriad">______</span> happy eyes are bent <br>
            Upon their changeless love alway; <br>
            As strengthened by their one intent, <br>
            They pour the <span id="flood">______</span> of life and day.
        </p>
        <p>
            So we, through this world’s waning night, <br>
            Shall, hand in hand, pursue our way; <br>
            Shed round us order, <span id="love">______</span>, and light, <br>
            And shine unto the perfect day.
        </p>
